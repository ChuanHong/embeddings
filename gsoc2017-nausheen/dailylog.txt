=============================================================================
30th May to 15th June 2017:
=============================================================================
Ran opensource codes for 
i) TransE
ii) HolE
iii) ComplEx

Pending Issues to fix:
i) HolE input format for FB15K

=============================================================================
16th June 2017:
=============================================================================
Done :
i)  DistMult executed for WN18 and FB15K
Results noted.

=============================================================================
19th June 2017 :
=============================================================================
To Do:
Run SSP model.

What I did :
* Tried to run SSP code on Linux Machine, some errors during runtime.
* SSP documentations says the authors used Intel C++ Compiler on Visual Studio.


=============================================================================
20th June 2017:
=============================================================================
What I did :
* Set up Visual studio and Intel C++ on a Windows machine.
* Had weekly hangout discussion with the mentors and decided to document and 
figure out :
    1) time complexity 
    2) space complexity/requirements 
for various models. 

=============================================================================
21st June 2017 to 24th June 2017:
=============================================================================
Tried to make SSP run on Linux and Windows. 
Unfortunately, it did not execute.

=============================================================================
25th June 2017 :
=============================================================================

1)  When I check the experiments table, the results of HoLE and ComplEx looks too similar.
So to gain some more insight, I edited the HoLE code to give Hits@1, Hits@3 and 
Hits@10 information.

The original code gave only Hits@10 values.

Ran the code and got resuts.

2) The HolE github code did not have the FB15K bin file dataset. I created the bin file for FB15K
from the benchmark FB15K dataset, and put the code for execution. The bin file was the required 
input format for running the code.

wrote : data2bin.py

3) Have put the HolE code running for the FB15K dataset from 2)
